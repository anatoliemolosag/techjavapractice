/*
1. Go to the Main class.
2. We have already created a scanner object inside the main method.
3. We asked the user to enter a random word.
4. Then we asked the user to input the number of letters that word consists of.
5. Lastly we asked user for a letter that they want to learn its index.
6. Your code should print true if the user entered a right number of letters in the word.Print false if the wrong number is entered.
7. Your code should print the index of the entered letter, if the word doesnâ€™t contain the letter then the code should print -1.
8. Please look at two example outputs below to understand how your code should work.
Please follow the order when you are printing.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
Enter a random word
Techtorial -> this line represents user's input
Enter number of letter that word consists
10 -> this line represents user's input
true
Enter a letter that you want to find an index
a -> this line represents user's input
8

SECOND EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Enter a random word
Java
Enter number of letter that word consists
6
false
Enter a letter that you want to find an index
v
2
