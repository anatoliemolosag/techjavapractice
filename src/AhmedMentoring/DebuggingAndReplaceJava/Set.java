    Interview Question :
    1) How can you make the elements unique with collection?(American Style)
    1)What is set ? what is the purpose of using it (indian Style)
      *(American) In my project , i was using set to make the items unique to prevent duplication which causes some problems for my project
      *Indian) Set is a way to store unique elements.

    2)can you tell me types of Collection

       *Set
       *List
       *Queue(we didn't learn that so you don't need to give information)

     3) Can you explain the difference between them (Set and List)

       Set:
       * Only unique elements
       *It doesn't have indexing(so you can access the elements by iteration for each loop)
       *Syntax is different --> Set numbers = new HasSet();


       List:
       * it can store duplicates as well
       *It has indexing , you can access elements by iteration for and for each loop
       *Syntax is different --> List number = new ArrayList();




      4) What is the difference between Set Type

        *HashSet() --> it stores elements without any orders
        *LinkedHashSet() --> it stores the element insertion(the order tha you put)
        *TreeSet() --> it stores the elements with ascending(sort) . No null.
