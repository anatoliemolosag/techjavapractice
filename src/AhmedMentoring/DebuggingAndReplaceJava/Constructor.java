    1)What is Constructor and can you do with it?
    **Constructor is a way to initialize the instance variables
    **Assign the value into the object.

    **2)Can you tell me difference between constructor and methods?
       Constructor : Doesn't have return type
       Methods : Does have return type
       Constructor : Must have same name of the class
       Methods : May or may not have same name of the class

     3)Can you make the cosntructor static , private or final?

     you can not make the constructor static or final . But you can make the constructor Private in some circumstances
     --> we have a singleton pattern design for my driver
     so at this time , i make  my constructor private to make sure it is not initialized outside of the class

    4) What is the difference between this, this(), super , super()?

    this -->  keyword in jave  means refers to instance variables
    this() --> refers to constructor from same class ** must be first line

    super --> refers to parent's instance variables and methods
    super() --> refers to parent's constructor
