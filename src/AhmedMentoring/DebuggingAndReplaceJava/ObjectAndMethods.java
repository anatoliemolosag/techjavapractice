    /*POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

    Facebook :
    1)What is object ?and tell me about methods?
    Object is a prezentation of the class(blueprint)
    There are many methods of object but we focus on thesse
         -->.equals -- > which is comparison
         -->.toString --> it showns all variables in a string mode
         --> .HashCode --> location of element(object)

     2) what is the difference between object and class
     Object and methods:
     Class: is a blue-print /template which you can create as many objects as you like
    Object : is a member or instance of class
    Object : you can create as many as you want.
    Class : one class i can have for this scenario
    Object : is declared with NEW keyword
    Class : is create with CLASS keyword
    Object : is the all parent of the class(Object as a Class)**not so often

    3)How do you initialize instance variables?
      * There are different way to initialize the instance variables .  I mostly used :
      ***Constructor
      *Methods(Setters)
      *Create an object
      *Directly assign the value for the instance variables


     4) WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INSTANCE VARIABLES AND LOCAL VARIABLES
     *Instance belong to the class
     *Local belongs the blocks, methods
     *Instance variables as default null, 0,0.0 , they are initialized
     *Local variables don't have default , will give you compile time
     *Instance variables can have access modifiers , static final
     *Local variables cannot have any of those keywords
