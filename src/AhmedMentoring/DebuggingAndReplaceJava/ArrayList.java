    Possible Interview Questions

    1- What is the difference between array and arrayList
    2-What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
    I do not use LinkedList but the efficiency of reaching out in ArrayList is faster than LinkedList
     **When you manipulate data LinkedList is faster .
     ** if you need more information you watch youtube.

    ARRAY :
      * Array has fixed size
      *Array has multidimentional form
      *Store both object and primitives
      *Array don't have methods and if it has only primitive data inside
         String[] has own methods
      *Synthax is different
          int[] array = new int[3];
          int[] array = {3,4,5};



    ARRAYLIST :
      *ArrayList is dynamic
      *ArrayLISt single dimentional
      *ArrayList stores only object
      *ArrayList has methods(add, remove, replace , size ..etc)
      *Synthax is different
            List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>;


           Common point array-arraylist:
            * Both have indexing (It means you can iterate with index number)
