/*Veera wants to lose 10 pounds in one month. There are multiple conditions to lose 10 pounds in a month. Veera needs to walk 10000 stepsÂ daily OR needs to run at least 4 miles a day and ADDITION to those Veera needs to eat less than 1500 calories daily. Create the application that calculate the given parameter and will print the true if Veera is able to lose 10 kg in one month.
The values for daily steps , daily calory and milest will automatically be inserted on the lines . For this exercise calculate the given parameters are enough for losing weight or not. If yes, print true, otherwise print false.
